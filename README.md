The article is being published in collaboration with JLCPCB. It is one of the most experienced PCB manufacturers with more than a decade in the field of PCB prototype and fabrication, they are committed to meeting the needs of our customers from different industries in terms of quality, delivery, cost-effectiveness and any other demanding requests.

# Introduction
Smart House automation refers to a system that automates a home by using information technology to monitor the environment, regulate electric appliances, and link to the outside world or the cloud. Smart Home is a complicated technology that is ever-evolving. This study looks at a prototype house environment monitoring and control system, which is one branch of the Smart Home. The system is built on an automation system and may serve as a home security guard. The house's temperature, humidity, gas density, water immersion, ambiance, and contaminants may all be monitored by the technology.

# Features
ESP32 is a single 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth combo chip designed with the TSMC ultra-low-power 40 nm technology. It is designed to achieve the best power and RF performance, showing robustness, versatility, and reliability in a wide variety of applications and power scenarios.

The relay module is an electromechanical device switch that may be switched on or off, allowing or disallowing current flow. They're made to run on low voltages like 3.3V (like the ESP32, ESP8266, and others) or 5V (like your Arduino). An electromagnet operates a power relay module, which is an electrical switch. A separate low-power signal from a controller activates the electromagnet. The electromagnet pulls to open or close an electrical circuit when actuated.

The smart home's best choice is Hi-newest Link's power module, which is ideal for smart house switch control devices, has a compact volume, low current, and low input voltage. 10500Hz vibration coefficient, 2g10min./1 cycle, 60 minutes Each along the x, y, and z axes Altitude: 2000 m or less, atmospheric pressure: 80-106 kPa The surface temperature on our primary power capacitor converter should not exceed 90° at normal operating temperatures, and the maximum temperature on the greatest surface of the hull should not exceed 60°. discharge of electrostatic charge 8 kV/15 kV IEC/EN 61000–4-2 level 4.

Current amplifiers, rapid switching, and pulse-width modulation are all common applications for BC547 (PWM). As a result, if you need to regulate the speed of a motor or actuator in one of your projects, this transistor will suffice.

# Ordering the PCBs From JLCPCB

Full Process is shown using Screenshots Step-wise.

Now we have got the PCB design and it’s time to order the PCB’s. For that, you just have to go to JLCPCB, and click on “QUOTE NOW” button.

JLCPCB are also sponsor of this project. JLCPCB (ShenzhenJLC Electronics Co., Ltd.), is the largest PCB prototype enterprise in Chinaand a high-tech manufacturer specializing in quick PCB prototype and small-batch PCB production. You can order a minimum of 5 PCBs for just $2.

To get the PCB manufactured, upload the gerber file you downloaded in the last step. Upload the.zip file or you can also drag and drop the gerber files.

After uploading the zip file, you’ll see a success message at the bottom if the file is successfully uploaded.

You can review the PCB in the Gerber viewer to make sure everything is good. You can view both top and bottom of the PCB. After making sure our PCB looks good, we can now place the order at a reasonable price. You can order 5 PCBs for just $2 but if it’s your first order then you can get 5 PCBs for $2.

To place the order, click on “SAVE TO CART” button. My PCBs took 2 days to get manufactured and arrived within a week using DHL delivery option. PCBs were well packed and the quality was really good.
